a baby
 

59
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,510
a baby
is born, the first thing you do is cut the umbilical cord.

60
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:42,520
is born, the first thing you do is cut the umbilical cord.
 

61
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,429

63
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,590

Why do you do that?

64

Why do you do that?
 

65
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,830
Why do you do that?
When a baby is in the mother's womb,

66
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
When a baby is in the mother's womb,
 

67
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,630
When a baby is in the mother's womb,
all the nutrients and elements necessary for life are

68
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
all the nutrients and elements necessary for life are
 

69
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,469
all the nutrients and elements necessary for life are
supplied through the excretion.

70
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:55,479
supplied through the excretion.
 

71
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,230
supplied through the excretion.
And also, breathing is also done through the

72
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
And also, breathing is also done through the
 

73
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,109
And also, breathing is also done through the

74
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119

 

75
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,950

placenta. The fetus

76
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:03,960
placenta. The fetus
 

77
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,429
placenta. The fetus
receives oxygen from the mother's blood and

78
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
receives oxygen from the mother's blood and
 

79
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,910
receives oxygen from the mother's blood and
expels carbon dioxide. All of these things are

80
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
expels carbon dioxide. All of these things are
 

81
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,949
expels carbon dioxide. All of these things are
done through the placenta.

82
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
done through the placenta.
 

83
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,229
done through the placenta.
However, from the moment it is born on this earth, it can no longer

84
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
However, from the moment it is born on this earth, it can no longer
 

85
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,750
However, from the moment it is born on this earth, it can no longer
receive any more supplies from its mother.

86
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
receive any more supplies from its mother.
 

87
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,830
receive any more supplies from its mother.
So,

88
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
So,
 

89
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,430
So,
life begins by cutting off the excretion.

90
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,440

 

91
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,869

And also, what is 100% common in all of them? They

92
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,229
And also, what is 100% common in all of them? They
 

93
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239

 

94
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,550

cry as soon as they are

95
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
cry as soon as they are
 

96
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,670
cry as soon as they are
born. So, if the baby doesn't cry when they are born, they

97
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,270
born. So, if the baby doesn't cry when they are born, they
 

98
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280

 

99
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,350

make them cry by hitting their buttocks. There is also a meaning to this. The reason

100
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,360
make them cry by hitting their buttocks. There is also a meaning to this. The reason
 

101
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,830
make them cry by hitting their buttocks. There is also a meaning to this. The reason
why the baby has to cry that initial sound is

102
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
why the baby has to cry that initial sound is
 

103
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,750
why the baby has to cry that initial sound is

104
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:48,760

 

105
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,550

because

106
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:51,560
because
 

107
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,110
because
air enters the space between the vocal cords that has never been used before,

108
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
air enters the space between the vocal cords that has never been used before,
 

109
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,390
air enters the space between the vocal cords that has never been used before,
creating a friction sound. This is the

110
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,400
creating a friction sound. This is the
 

111
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,190
creating a friction sound. This is the
first time for babies. So,

112
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,200
first time for babies. So,
 

113
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,030
first time for babies. So,
now that the umbilical cord is cut, breathing,

114
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
now that the umbilical cord is cut, breathing,
 

115
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,589
now that the umbilical cord is cut, breathing,
inhaling oxygen,

116
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
inhaling oxygen,
 

117
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,990
inhaling oxygen,
exhaling carbon dioxide, all of these things must be

118
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,000
exhaling carbon dioxide, all of these things must be
 

119
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,670
exhaling carbon dioxide, all of these things must be
done in a different way to live. So,

120
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
done in a different way to live. So,
 

121
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,190
done in a different way to live. So,
humans

122
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,200
humans
 

123
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,910
humans
have this shift from the time they are born.  They

124
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:16,920
have this shift from the time they are born.  They
 

125
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,990
have this shift from the time they are born.  They
used the expression “born”. When I

126
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,070

 

127
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080

 

128
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,309

read a book explaining this principle, it said that if you cut off the old to

129
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
read a book explaining this principle, it said that if you cut off the old to
 

130
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,030
read a book explaining this principle, it said that if you cut off the old to
live a new life in the new world, it’s the

131
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
live a new life in the new world, it’s the
 

132
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,910
live a new life in the new world, it’s the
same spiritually. I

133
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
same spiritually. I
 

134
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,990
same spiritually. I
thought that

135
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,000

thought that
believing in Jesus

137
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:37,400
believing in Jesus
 

138
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,750
believing in Jesus
means something like this. Some people say, “

139
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:40,760
means something like this. Some people say, “
 

140
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,949
means something like this. Some people say, “

00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
New life is being granted.
 

164
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,910
New life is being granted.
So if we say that we believe in Jesus, we

165
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,870
So if we say that we believe in Jesus, we
 

166
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,229

 

167
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239

 

168
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,510

have to cut off the strings of our way of life that has relied on our own strength and looked at the world. We have to block

169
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,520
have to cut off the strings of our way of life that has relied on our own strength and looked at the world. We have to block
 

170
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,749
have to cut off the strings of our way of life that has relied on our own strength and looked at the world. We have to block
all the channels that have been effective in our way of living,

171
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
all the channels that have been effective in our way of living,
 

172
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,710
all the channels that have been effective in our way of living,
and now we

173
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:29,720
and now we
 

174
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,550
and now we
recognize that we are beings who can receive supplies from God and

175
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,070
recognize that we are beings who can receive supplies from God and
 

176
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,080

 

177
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,710

live. This is a

178
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
live. This is a
 

179
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,950
live. This is a
life of faith. Today, as

180
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:41,960
life of faith. Today, as
 

181
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,710
life of faith. Today, as
I meditated on verse 6 of Psalm 23,

182
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,870
I meditated on verse 6 of Psalm 23,
 

183
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880

 

184
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,830

I received many messages from this short verse. I studied it a lot and

185
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:50,840
I received many messages from this short verse. I studied it a lot and
 

186
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,749
I received many messages from this short verse. I studied it a lot and
enjoyed grace during the week. It

187
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
enjoyed grace during the week. It
 

188
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,710
enjoyed grace during the week. It
all started with the beginning of Psalm 23.

189
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
all started with the beginning of Psalm 23.
 

190
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,790
all started with the beginning of Psalm 23.
Don't you do this? Verse 1

191
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,430
Don't you do this? Verse 1
 

192
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,510

 

193
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520

 

194
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,150

says, "He is my shepherd; I shall not want."

195
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,160
says, "He is my shepherd; I shall not want."
 

196
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,950
says, "He is my shepherd; I shall not want."
This is the shift. If we do what the book says, this is the

197
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
This is the shift. If we do what the book says, this is the
 

198
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,070
This is the shift. If we do what the book says, this is the
transformation. When you read this verse, you may think, "Oh,

199
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
transformation. When you read this verse, you may think, "Oh,
 

200
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,189
transformation. When you read this verse, you may think, "Oh,
what did I need to fill up to be satisfied in the past?

201
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
what did I need to fill up to be satisfied in the past?
 

202
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,670
what did I need to fill up to be satisfied in the past?
Oh, I need to have money in my bank account to

203
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
Oh, I need to have money in my bank account to
 

204
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,909
Oh, I need to have money in my bank account to
eat and live until I die,

205
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:20,919
eat and live until I die,
 

206
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,110
eat and live until I die,
and I need to have a job that I can be recognized for,

207
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
and I need to have a job that I can be recognized for,
 

208
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,469
and I need to have a job that I can be recognized for,
and I need to be respected by people to some

209
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:25,479
and I need to be respected by people to some
 

210
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,110
and I need to be respected by people to some
extent. I live in a world that keeps singing that I need to have these things

211
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,120
extent. I live in a world that keeps singing that I need to have these things
 

212
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,510
extent. I live in a world that keeps singing that I need to have these things
filled up so that I don't lack anything in life." But

213
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,550
filled up so that I don't lack anything in life." But
 

214
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,710

 

215
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:35,720

 

216
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,510

now that I know Jesus,

217
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:38,520
now that I know Jesus,
 

218
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,270
now that I know Jesus,
we are now realizing that this is not the case.

219
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,280
we are now realizing that this is not the case.
 

220
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,350
we are now realizing that this is not the case.
That's why David says, "Because the Lord

221
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
That's why David says, "Because the Lord
 

222
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,430
That's why David says, "Because the Lord
is my shepherd, I shall

223
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,440
is my shepherd, I shall
 

224
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,390
is my shepherd, I shall
not want anything." David begins his words

225
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
not want anything." David begins his words
 

226
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,670
not want anything." David begins his words
by saying this, and in verse 6, he concludes his words with

227
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
by saying this, and in verse 6, he concludes his words with
 

228
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,590
by saying this, and in verse 6, he concludes his words with
this: "Goodness and

229
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:56,600
this: "Goodness and
 

230
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,990
this: "Goodness and
mercy shall surely follow me all my days, and I will dwell

231
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
mercy shall surely follow me all my days, and I will dwell
 

232
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,749
mercy shall surely follow me all my days, and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

233
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:05,189
in the house of the Lord forever."
 

234
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199

 

235
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,589

He talks about the way of life. This

236
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:07,599
He talks about the way of life. This
 

237
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,510
He talks about the way of life. This
week, I will speak about the sentence, "Goodness and

243
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,710

I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Next week, at the end, I will say this one sentence, "I

244
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Next week, at the end, I will say this one sentence, "I
 

245
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,749
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Next week, at the end, I will say this one sentence, "I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." I will preach this next

246
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." I will preach this next
 

247
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,670
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." I will preach this next
week, and Psalm 23.

248
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:26,680
week, and Psalm 23.

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,070
week, and Psalm 23.
It's organized. In this sense, I

250
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,710
It's organized. In this sense, I
 

251
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,909

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,029

hope that today, with the first part of verse 6 of chapter 23, I and you will experience a change in life. The decision to cut the umbilical cord

hope that today, with the first part of verse 6 of chapter 23, I and you will experience a change in life. The decision to cut the umbilical cord
will occur, and I will no longer be someone who relies on something of my own and

257
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:44,360
will occur, and I will no longer be someone who relies on something of my own and
 

258
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,390
will occur, and I will no longer be someone who relies on something of my own and
lives according to the world's order,

259
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
lives according to the world's order,
 

260
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,550
lives according to the world's order,
but a person who

261
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,230
but a person who
 

262
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240

 

263
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,950

is now Jehovah my shepherd, and I will

live a
life where I rely on Him and live with what He provides. I hope that

268
00:06:59,550 --> 00:06:59,560
life where I rely on Him and live with what He provides. I hope that
 

269
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,950
life where I rely on Him and live with what He provides. I hope that
you will become saints of faith like this.

270
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,469
you will become saints of faith like this.
 

271
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:05,479

 

272
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,710

So

So
 

274
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,430
So
I came up with this title.

I came up with this title.
Two words to remember for a shift in life. You need

Two words to remember for a shift in life. You need

one of the very first words in the Bible.

It came from the process of creating heaven and earth. Let me

The Bible begins with God's declaration. It's
not that monkeys evolved

not that monkeys evolved
 

309
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,029
not that monkeys evolved
or anything like that, but that God

00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:17,319
created the heavens and the earth. And now the
 

318
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,589
created the heavens and the earth. And now the
content is verse 2. The earth was formless and

319
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
content is verse 2. The earth was formless and
 

320
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,309
content is verse 2. The earth was formless and
empty, and darkness

321
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
empty, and darkness
 

322
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,469
empty, and darkness
was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And

323
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And
 

324
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,990
was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And
God said, "Let there be

325
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,000
God said, "Let there be
 

326
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,790
God said, "Let there be
light." And there was light. And God said, "It

327
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
light." And there was light. And God said, "It
 

328
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,310
light." And there was light. And God said, "It
is good."

329
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
is good."
 

330
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,790
is good."
And on the second day,

331
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
And on the second day,
 

332
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,269
And on the second day,
God created it like this. And in conclusion,

333
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
God created it like this. And in conclusion,
 

334
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,790
God created it like this. And in conclusion,
God saw that it was good. On the third day,

335
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
God saw that it was good. On the third day,
 

336
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,590
God saw that it was good. On the third day,
it was good. So if you look at the Bible, it goes

337
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
it was good. So if you look at the Bible, it goes
 

338
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,910
it was good. So if you look at the Bible, it goes
on and on from the very beginning.

339
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
on and on from the very beginning.
 

340
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,269
on and on from the very beginning.
So, everyone,

341
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
So, everyone,
 

342
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,910
So, everyone,
the goodness and kindness of my life will

343
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:56,920
the goodness and kindness of my life will
 

344
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,750
the goodness and kindness of my life will
surely follow me.

345
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
surely follow me.
 

346
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,870
surely follow me.
How should we meditate

347
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,190
How should we meditate
 

348
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,200

 

349
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,550

on this goodness? When God created the heavens and the earth, it means that it was good.

350
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:07,560
on this goodness? When God created the heavens and the earth, it means that it was good.
 

351
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,710
on this goodness? When God created the heavens and the earth, it means that it was good.
Oh, God, I used good materials.

352
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:09,720
Oh, God, I used good materials.
 

353
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,949
Oh, God, I used good materials.
Oh, this is

354
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:11,959
Oh, this is
 

355
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,550
Oh, this is
not like this. Here, Tov does not mean that God

356
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
not like this. Here, Tov does not mean that God
 

357
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,670
not like this. Here, Tov does not mean that God
created it with a purpose. It

358
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
created it with a purpose. It
 

359
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,150
created it with a purpose. It
was created according to His intention.

360
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,160
was created according to His intention.
 

361
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,710
was created according to His intention.
This does not mean that Tov was well made.

362
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
This does not mean that Tov was well made.
 

363
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,670
This does not mean that Tov was well made.
Of course, that is implied,

364
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,680
Of course, that is implied,
 

365
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,310
Of course, that is implied,
but it is said that

366
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
but it is said that
 

367
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,310
but it is said that
God created it well according to His intention.  It

368
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,630
God created it well according to His intention.  It
 

369
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:37,640

 

370
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,949

was good to see, so that's why we who believed in Jesus

371
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,389
was good to see, so that's why we who believed in Jesus
 

372
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399

 

373
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,910

came here by following the goodness of God. It's not goodness in the sense that I

374
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:46,920
came here by following the goodness of God. It's not goodness in the sense that I
 

375
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,990
came here by following the goodness of God. It's not goodness in the sense that I
became rich, I lived well, I

376
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
became rich, I lived well, I
 

377
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,389
became rich, I lived well, I
became famous.

378
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,030
became famous.
 

379
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,040

 

380
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,990

When God sent me to this earth,

381
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
When God sent me to this earth,
 

382
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,509
When God sent me to this earth,
living a life according to the will of God is

383
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:04,519
living a life according to the will of God is
 

384
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,310
living a life according to the will of God is
goodness. So, in Ephesians 2:10, it

385
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,949
goodness. So, in Ephesians 2:10, it
 

386
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,910

 

387
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,870

 

388
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:15,880

 

389
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,590

says that we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works. Even if we cook rice, the life that

390
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
says that we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works. Even if we cook rice, the life that
 

391
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,269
says that we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works. Even if we cook rice, the life that
God intended for us to

392
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
God intended for us to
 

393
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,030
God intended for us to
live

394
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
live
 

395
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,069
live
is a successful life.

396
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079

 

397
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,470

I told you all about a young man who was pessimistic about his

398
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:33,480
I told you all about a young man who was pessimistic about his
 

399
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,949
I told you all about a young man who was pessimistic about his
life and thought that

400
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
life and thought that
 

401
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,949
life and thought that
all that was left for him to do was to die.

402
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,069
all that was left for him to do was to die.
 

403
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,870

 

404
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880

 

405
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,150

He had actually attempted

406
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
He had actually attempted
 

407
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,269
He had actually attempted
suicide again just before I met him, but

408
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:50,279
suicide again just before I met him, but
 

409
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,430
suicide again just before I met him, but
it didn't work out. When I

410
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,440
it didn't work out. When I
 

411
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,069
it didn't work out. When I
met him, I was

412
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
met him, I was
 

413
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,990
met him, I was
very worried. It

414
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
very worried. It
 

415
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,590
very worried. It
was

416
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
was
 

417
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,430
was
so heartbreaking.

418
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:02,440
so heartbreaking.
 

419
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,350
so heartbreaking.
How

420
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,360
How
 

421
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,629
How
could we know the details? He had been living alone for a long time, isolated from his parents.

422
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,190
could we know the details? He had been living alone for a long time, isolated from his parents.
 

423
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200

 

424
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,710

Since he lived alone, I listened to his brother's story for an hour.

425
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,350
Since he lived alone, I listened to his brother's story for an hour.
 

426
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,360

 

427
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,269

I

428
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:20,030
I
 

429
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,670

 

430
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,230

 

431
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,389

 

432
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,509

 

433
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:28,519

 

434
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,790


435
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:29,800

 

436
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,870

see that you are anxious. You are alone when you get home. I wonder if even if I encourage you for an hour, pat you on the back, and pray for you, will the fundamental problem be solved. I am very worried about that, so I spoke to the young man. I see that you live alone now, so it

437
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
see that you are anxious. You are alone when you get home. I wonder if even if I encourage you for an hour, pat you on the back, and pray for you, will the fundamental problem be solved. I am very worried about that, so I spoke to the young man. I see that you live alone now, so it
 

438
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,190
see that you are anxious. You are alone when you get home. I wonder if even if I encourage you for an hour, pat you on the back, and pray for you, will the fundamental problem be solved. I am very worried about that, so I spoke to the young man. I see that you live alone now, so it
seems that you need some help.

439
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
seems that you need some help.
 

440
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,430
seems that you need some help.
So if you allow me,

441
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,440
So if you allow me,
 

442
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,110
So if you allow me,
I would like to explain this content well during the sermon on Sunday and

443
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,150
I would like to explain this content well during the sermon on Sunday and
 

444
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,160

 

445
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,750

find someone who can help our brother. Is that okay?

446
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,230
find someone who can help our brother. Is that okay?
 

447
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240

 

448
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,389

When I talk about someone's personal story, I usually

449
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,470
When I talk about someone's personal story, I usually
 

450
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:55,480

 

451
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,269

get permission to talk about serious stories. I asked if

452
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
get permission to talk about serious stories. I asked if
 

453
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,230
get permission to talk about serious stories. I asked if
I could talk about you,

454
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
I could talk about you,
 

455
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,790
I could talk about you,
and then suddenly this

456
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
and then suddenly this
 

457
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,550
and then suddenly this
person said, "I can reveal my name. I want you to

458
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,910
person said, "I can reveal my name. I want you to
 

459
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:08,920

 

460
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,750

help me find that everything is okay in my brother's heart. I

461
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,509
help me find that everything is okay in my brother's heart. I
 

462
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:14,519

 

463
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,189

think it just came out because I was so desperate." That was in September of last

464
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:19,199
think it just came out because I was so desperate." That was in September of last
 

465
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,430
think it just came out because I was so desperate." That was in September of last

466
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:22,440

 

467
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,750

year. Do you remember? Pastors who still remember what I preached last year

468
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
year. Do you remember? Pastors who still remember what I preached last year
 

469
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,790
year. Do you remember? Pastors who still remember what I preached last year
really hate that kind of thing. That's

470
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,230
really hate that kind of thing. That's
 

471
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240

 

472
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,829

because even if I repeat the sermon I gave last week as if it was the first time,

473
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
because even if I repeat the sermon I gave last week as if it was the first time,
 

474
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,750
because even if I repeat the sermon I gave last week as if it was the first time,
our pastor

475
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,430
our pastor
 

476

connected him. And then I had

499
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
connected him. And then I had
 

500
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,710

n’t heard from him since then, so I

501
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:17,720
n’t heard from him since then, so I
 

502
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,829
n’t heard from him since then, so I
had forgotten about him, but he contacted me a while ago. To be

503
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:20,839

504
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,310

506
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,189

was no news or a brother contacting me, I wondered if he was

633
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,069

does not mean becoming rich, living well, and being famous. It's because this brother realized the meaning of life

637
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,910

and began to find out what kind of meaning God gave him when He sent him to this earth, and he

638
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,030

And there, Jesus said,  Meditate on the things Jesus did on earth.

659
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,870
And there, Jesus said,  Meditate on the things Jesus did on earth.

His mentor told him

681
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,909
His mentor told him
 

682
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919

 

683
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,390

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,710

began to recall the good things God had intervened in him. He

689
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
began to recall the good things God had intervened in him. He
 

690
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,390
began to recall the good things God had intervened in him. He
said that when he was young, he was

691
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,400
said that when he was young, he was
 

692

bullied at school.

bullied at school.
 

694
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,789
bullied at school.
He was bullied, and at that time, God

695
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
He was bullied, and at that time, God
 

696
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,070
He was bullied, and at that time, God
gave him strength.

697
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,070
gave him strength.
 

698
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,870

700
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,669

Listen to the next part of the letter. I thought my past was

701
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
Listen to the next part of the letter. I thought my past was
 

702
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,630
Listen to the next part of the letter. I thought my past was
full of suffering, but as I did that, I

703
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,990
full of suffering, but as I did that, I
 

704
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,270

 

705
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,280

 

706
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,430

discovered that I had not been grateful for the things God had done for me in the past and had left.

707
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
discovered that I had not been grateful for the things God had done for me in the past and had left.
 

708

What this means is that when I

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,430
What this means is that when I
met him, I despaired, and the

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:00,440
met him, I despaired, and the
 

712
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,789
met him, I despaired, and the
reason I resented God

713
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
reason I resented God
 

714
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,070
reason I resented God
was because God had abandoned me. God

715
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
was because God had abandoned me. God
 

716
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,390
was because God had abandoned me. God
abandoned me, and so I

717
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
abandoned me, and so I

something amazing happened. As he read and

725
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:21,159
something amazing happened. As he read and
 

726
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,070
something amazing happened. As he read and
meditated on them, he began to recall things that he had forgotten about when

727

God was with him during difficult times. There

729
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,149
God was with him during difficult times. There
 

730
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:28,159

733
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,230

739
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,430

Wasn't it the same for Joseph? If we

798
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,320
Wasn't it the same for Joseph? If we
 

799
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,990
Wasn't it the same for Joseph? If we
consider hardships, Joseph was like his

800
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,000
consider hardships, Joseph was like his
 

801
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,390
consider hardships, Joseph was like his
brothers. He was threatened with death by his half-brother,

802
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
brothers. He was threatened with death by his half-brother,
 

803
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,510
brothers. He was threatened with death by his half-brother,
sold to another country, and

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:22,520
sold to another country, and
 

805
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,310
sold to another country, and
unjustly imprisoned. But

806
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,320
unjustly imprisoned. But
 

807
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,549
unjustly imprisoned. But
everyone, read the Bible. There is

808
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
everyone, read the Bible. There is
 

809
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,269
everyone, read the Bible. There is
no trace of Joseph. How was this possible

810
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:31,279
no trace of Joseph. How was this possible
 

811
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,470
no trace of Joseph. How was this possible
? The answer is in the famous words he said to his brothers after he had lived his entire life and

812
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:35,480
? The answer is in the famous words he said to his brothers after he had lived his entire life and
 

813
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,710
? The answer is in the famous words he said to his brothers after he had lived his entire life and
overcome it.

814
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:37,720
overcome it.

989
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,549
planted in a two-year-old because God
was guiding me with goodness.

990

have followed me throughout my life that
I was forgiven and given a chance to stand up again.

00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:07,830
I was forgiven and given a chance to stand up again.

book I introduced earlier, an attitude toward life that moves forward without wavering,
 

1068
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,590
book I introduced earlier, an attitude toward life that moves forward without wavering,
says that a

Why do we live such a life?  Since the shift

Why do we live such a life?  Since the shift
 

1076
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,789
Why do we live such a life?  Since the shift
doesn't happen well, I asked

00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:27,799
doesn't happen well, I asked
 

1078
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,909
doesn't happen well, I asked
what emotions are interfering with it.

1079
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:29,919
what emotions are interfering with it.
 

1080
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,669
what emotions are interfering with it.
There are several. First, anxiety

There are several. First, anxiety
 

1082
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,830
There are several. First, anxiety
holds back our change. I'll explain it all.

are anxious when we get up and lie down. We wake up in the morning and
start the day with anxiety before it even starts.

1106
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
start the day with anxiety before it even starts.
 

1107
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,470
start the day with anxiety before it even starts.
That's the structure.

1108
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
That's the structure.
 

1109
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,029
That's the structure.
Today's era is depressing. Smartphones

1110
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:18,039
Today's era is depressing. Smartphones
 

1111
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,269
Today's era is depressing. Smartphones
have come out and we are even more depressed.

1112
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:20,279
have come out and we are even more depressed.
 

1113
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,549
have come out and we are even more depressed.
The news we look at every day makes us depressed. It

1114
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,750
The news we look at every day makes us depressed. It
 

1115
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:24,760

 

1116
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,110

causes anger. It's burnout. And this

1117
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,120
causes anger. It's burnout. And this
 

1118
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,350
causes anger. It's burnout. And this
era keeps destroying our self-esteem.

1119
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,360
era keeps destroying our self-esteem.
 

1120
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,710
era keeps destroying our self-esteem.
In the old days,

1121
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
In the old days,
 

1122
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,630
In the old days,
when there were no smartphones,

1123
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
when there were no smartphones,
 

1124
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,070
when there were no smartphones,
no one knew who was living so well.

1125
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,080
no one knew who was living so well.
 

1126
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,830
no one knew who was living so well.
I lived in a poor neighborhood.

1127
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
I lived in a poor neighborhood.
 

1128
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,750
I lived in a poor neighborhood.
Even though the whole world was poor, I was born in a

1129
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
Even though the whole world was poor, I was born in a
 

1130
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,549
Even though the whole world was poor, I was born in a
neighborhood that was like that, but I guess the whole

1131
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:45,559
neighborhood that was like that, but I guess the whole
 

1132
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,149
neighborhood that was like that, but I guess the whole
world lives like this.  I

1133
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:47,159
world lives like this.  I
 

1134
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,669
world lives like this.  I
thought I would go to the podium every day and drink and

1135
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
thought I would go to the podium every day and drink and
 

1136
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,350
thought I would go to the podium every day and drink and
live like that. I

1137
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,360
live like that. I
 

1138
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,190
live like that. I
can't name people. I drank so much coal briquette gas that I

1139
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,200
can't name people. I drank so much coal briquette gas that I
 

1140
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,630
can't name people. I drank so much coal briquette gas that I

1141
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:55,640

 

1142
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,669

had no complaints. Because of that, I

1143
00:29:58,669 --> 00:29:58,679
had no complaints. Because of that, I
 

1144
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,909
had no complaints. Because of that, I
didn't have any difficulties in my heart. But

1145
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:00,919
didn't have any difficulties in my heart. But
 

1146
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:04,029
didn't have any difficulties in my heart. But
now that smartphones have broken my self-esteem,

1147
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:04,039
now that smartphones have broken my self-esteem,
 

1148
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,710
now that smartphones have broken my self-esteem,
people

1149
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
people
 

1150
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,230
people
keep posting about how great I am and the more I travel around the world, the more

1151
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,310
keep posting about how great I am and the more I travel around the world, the more
 

1152
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,320

 

1153
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,149

depressed I become.

1154
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
depressed I become.
 

1155
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,029
depressed I become.
You guys

1156
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:18,039
You guys
 

1157
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:21,310
You guys
need to cut that umbilical cord. God doesn't evaluate people by those

1158
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,320
need to cut that umbilical cord. God doesn't evaluate people by those
 

1159
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,509
need to cut that umbilical cord. God doesn't evaluate people by those

1160
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:22,519

 

1161
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,269

things, and Hesed, who unconditionally

1162
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:26,279
things, and Hesed, who unconditionally
 

1163
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,830
things, and Hesed, who unconditionally
forgives and loves those who don't deserve it,

1164
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,710
forgives and loves those who don't deserve it,
 

1165
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,389

 

1166
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:34,399

 

1167
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,029

will surely follow me all my life. But there's

1168
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
will surely follow me all my life. But there's
 

1169
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,310
will surely follow me all my life. But there's
one thing you need to remember about Hesed. As

1170
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,320
one thing you need to remember about Hesed. As
 

1171
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,509
one thing you need to remember about Hesed. As
I said earlier,

1172
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:41,519
I said earlier,
 

1173
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,149
I said earlier,
in the Old Testament, Hesed is God's character.

1174
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:45,159
in the Old Testament, Hesed is God's character.
 

1175
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:47,710
in the Old Testament, Hesed is God's character.
So when Hesed reveals God's character, the

1176
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:47,720
So when Hesed reveals God's character, the
 

1177
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,310
So when Hesed reveals God's character, the
word Se appears, and

1178
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,320
word Se appears, and
 

1179
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,190
word Se appears, and
there are times when this word is used toward humans.

1180
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,200
there are times when this word is used toward humans.
 

1181
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,509
there are times when this word is used toward humans.
A representative example is Micah 6:8. You

1182
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:56,519
A representative example is Micah 6:8. You
 

1183
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,070
A representative example is Micah 6:8. You

1184
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,029

 

1185
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:00,039

 

1186
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,549

have shown me, O man, what is good. What does the LORD require of me

1187
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:02,559
have shown me, O man, what is good. What does the LORD require of me
 

1188
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,549
have shown me, O man, what is good. What does the LORD require of me
but to do justice and

1189
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:05,559
but to do justice and
 

1190
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,110
but to do justice and
to love kindness? This Hesed is what God

1191
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,120
to love kindness? This Hesed is what God
 

1192
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:28,509
to love kindness? This Hesed is what God
requires. Hesed Edu

1193
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:28,519

 

1194
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,190

Mentor Deacon  That girl, when she met me, she

1195
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,200
Mentor Deacon  That girl, when she met me, she
 

1196
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,350
Mentor Deacon  That girl, when she met me, she
kept

1197
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,360
kept
 

1198
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,430
kept
calling me uncle. When I met that uncle,

1199
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:38,440
calling me uncle. When I met that uncle,
 

1200
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,789
calling me uncle. When I met that uncle,
that uncle

1201
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
that uncle
 

1202
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,190
that uncle
told me to read the Four Gospels and

1203
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,200
told me to read the Four Gospels and
 

1204
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,190
told me to read the Four Gospels and
I corrected him. That mentor

1205
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,200
I corrected him. That mentor
 

1206
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,830
I corrected him. That mentor
deacon said that. So that person said that

1207
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:48,840
deacon said that. So that person said that
 

1208
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,509
deacon said that. So that person said that
uncle, my uncle, did that. I

1209
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,310
uncle, my uncle, did that. I
 

1210
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320

 

1211
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,830

thought about it. If that

1212
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:56,840
thought about it. If that
 

1213
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,310
thought about it. If that
deacon had a great gift of teaching and

1214
00:31:59,310 --> 00:31:59,320
deacon had a great gift of teaching and
 

1215
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,669
deacon had a great gift of teaching and
met this young man and suddenly said, “

1216
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
met this young man and suddenly said, “
 

1217
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,590
met this young man and suddenly said, “
Now, read this. You, I believe in Jesus. I

1218
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
Now, read this. You, I believe in Jesus. I
 

1219
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,389
Now, read this. You, I believe in Jesus. I
can commit suicide. No. I can’t commit suicide.

can commit suicide. No. I can’t commit suicide.
 

1221
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,669
can commit suicide. No. I can’t commit suicide.
Don’t think like that.” If he

1222
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
Don’t think like that.” If he
 

1223
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,029
Don’t think like that.” If he
had approached

1224
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039

 

1225
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,830

him like that, what would have happened? That deacon

1226
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
him like that, what would have happened? That deacon
 

1227
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,629
him like that, what would have happened? That deacon
didn’t approach this brother like that. He approached him in threes.

1228
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:18,639
didn’t approach this brother like that. He approached him in threes.
 

1229
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:22,269
didn’t approach this brother like that. He approached him in threes.
For no reason, he

1230
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:22,279
For no reason, he
 

1231
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,870
For no reason, he
bought our young man a very delicious meal for the first time. He may

1232
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:25,880
bought our young man a very delicious meal for the first time. He may
 

1233
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,830
bought our young man a very delicious meal for the first time. He may
have given him a gift, although I don’t know. He may

1234
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:28,840
have given him a gift, although I don’t know. He may
 

1235
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,269
have given him a gift, although I don’t know. He may
have even given him pocket money.

1236
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:35,269
have even given him pocket money.
 

1237
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,279

 

1238
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,190

He showed this brother the love of Hesed with all his heart. Isn’t

1239
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
He showed this brother the love of Hesed with all his heart. Isn’t
 

1240
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,509
He showed this brother the love of Hesed with all his heart. Isn’t
it power to recommend that he read the Four Gospels with that love

1241
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:44,750
it power to recommend that he read the Four Gospels with that love
 

1242
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:44,760

 

1243
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,870

? Today, I hope that

1244
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:47,880
? Today, I hope that
 

1245
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,590
? Today, I hope that
God’s unconditional love, Hesed, will

1246
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:50,600
God’s unconditional love, Hesed, will
 

1247
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,509
God’s unconditional love, Hesed, will
be enjoyed a lot. And we must remember the

be enjoyed a lot. And we must remember the
 

1249
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,710
be enjoyed a lot. And we must remember the
Lord’s words that we must also give it.  Let's

1250
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,070
Lord’s words that we must also give it.  Let's
 

1251
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,080

 

1252
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,669

take a look at Genesis 39:5, which you all know.

1253
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,470
take a look at Genesis 39:5, which you all know.

1255
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,389

From the time he made Joseph in charge of his house and all that he had, you

1256
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:06,399
From the time he made Joseph in charge of his house and all that he had, you
 

1257
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,710
From the time he made Joseph in charge of his house and all that he had, you
must listen carefully to this. The Lord

1258
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,720
must listen carefully to this. The Lord
 

1259
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,029
must listen carefully to this. The Lord
blessed Joseph's house for Joseph's sake. If

1260
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
blessed Joseph's house for Joseph's sake. If
 

1261
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,350
blessed Joseph's house for Joseph's sake. If
I read it like this,

1262
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
I read it like this,
 

1263
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,909
I read it like this,
this is the world's perspective that still can't be kicked out, but the

1264
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:18,919
this is the world's perspective that still can't be kicked out, but the
 

1265
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,470
this is the world's perspective that still can't be kicked out, but the
perspective of God in the Bible is this.

1266
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,669
perspective of God in the Bible is this.
 

1267
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:23,679

 

1268
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,750

From the time he made Joseph in charge of his house and all that he had, then

1269
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
From the time he made Joseph in charge of his house and all that he had, then
 

1270
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,909
From the time he made Joseph in charge of his house and all that he had, then
look next. The Lord

1271
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:29,919
look next. The Lord
 

1272
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,110
look next. The Lord
blessed Joseph's house.

1273
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,120
blessed Joseph's house.
 

1274
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,710
blessed Joseph's house.

You guys are just watching this because it's someone else's story, but think about
it as your own story right now. If

1277
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,080
it as your own story right now. If
 

1278
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,190
it as your own story right now. If
God said

1279
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
God said
 

1280
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,909
God said

I want to bless you for your hard work. I

want you to bless me and make your mother do well, then

want you to bless me and make your mother do well, then
 

1289
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,629

would you all say, Hallelujah? Oh,

God, I am. If God said to you,

1293
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,200
God, I am. If God said to you,
 

1294

God, I am. If God said to you,
I will bless you and make your

Just preaching on Sundays and

Just preaching on Sundays and

Just preaching on Sundays and

going to the wedding hall and all that kind of stuff
 

1318
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,909
going to the wedding hall and all that kind of stuff
doesn't do the job of a pastor. I

1319
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:35,919
doesn't do the job of a pastor. I
 

1320
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,109
doesn't do the job of a pastor. I
really want my life to be a life that provides gifts to you,

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,950

This

1326
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960

 

1327
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,990

is the spirit of Hesed. You

1328
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,000
is the spirit of Hesed. You
 

1329
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,349
is the spirit of Hesed. You
must remember two things. First, we

1330
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:54,359
must remember two things. First, we
 

1331
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,710
must remember two things. First, we
need a shift in our lives, a change in our lives, and

1332
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:57,720
need a shift in our lives, a change in our lives, and
 

1333
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,990
need a shift in our lives, a change in our lives, and
the first ingredient is Tobu.

1334
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,349
the first ingredient is Tobu.
 

1335
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359

 

1336
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,390

In order to find the meaning that God created me, I

1337
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
In order to find the meaning that God created me, I
 

1338
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,750
In order to find the meaning that God created me, I
can find even a valley where the shadow of death is cast over me.

1339
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:08,760
can find even a valley where the shadow of death is cast over me.
 

1340
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,270
can find even a valley where the shadow of death is cast over me.
I was able to find it.

1341
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
I was able to find it.
 

1342
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,109
I was able to find it.
Then the second

1343
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
Then the second
 

1344
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,030
Then the second
word is the goodness and mercy of my life, Hesed.

1345
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
word is the goodness and mercy of my life, Hesed.
 

1346
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,630
word is the goodness and mercy of my life, Hesed.
Hesed. So, first of all, I hope that you will

Especially these days, we

this age where various wounds are constantly being produced, only God knows
 

1376
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,950
this age where various wounds are constantly being produced, only God knows
whether you are right or I am right. Let's

1377
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,870
whether you are right or I am right. Let's
 

1378

together that God will have pity on our country even when something
 

1383
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,950
together that God will have pity on our country even when something

more desperate than this

more desperate than this
 

1387
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:20,109
more desperate than this
happened, with God's love of Hesed.

1392
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,430

Isn't it because God protected us that our country has come this far?

1393
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,440
Isn't it because God protected us that our country has come this far?
 

1394
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,870
Isn't it because God protected us that our country has come this far?
Everyone, you and I have experienced this revival first for that reason, so

Everyone, you and I have experienced this revival first for that reason, so

1397
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,470

I am touched. I am

1398
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
I am touched. I am
 

1399
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,630
I am touched. I am
not qualified to preach, but

1400
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:39,640
not qualified to preach, but
 

1401
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,829
not qualified to preach, but
God is preaching, but I still

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
God is preaching, but I still
 

1403
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,510
God is preaching, but I still
can't make excuses. God's love of Hesed has

1404
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,520
can't make excuses. God's love of Hesed has
 

1405
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,910
can't make excuses. God's love of Hesed has
allowed me to stand here.

1406
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:46,920
allowed me to stand here.

Blessed are the merciful, for
 

1415
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,670
Blessed are the merciful, for
they will be shown mercy. It

1416
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
they will be shown mercy. It
 

1417
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,309
they will be shown mercy. It
is a virtuous cycle. If I

1418
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:04,319
is a virtuous cycle. If I
 

1419
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:06,750
is a virtuous cycle. If I
pour out the love of Hesed that I received onto someone,

1420
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:06,760
pour out the love of Hesed that I received onto someone,
 

1421
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,710
pour out the love of Hesed that I received onto someone,
God will be pleased with it and

God will be pleased with it and
 

1423
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,950
God will be pleased with it and
return it to me with a greater Hesed. I think that this player of love is the alternative that

1424
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
return it to me with a greater Hesed. I think that this player of love is the alternative that
 

1425

return it to me with a greater Hesed. I think that this player of love is the alternative that
the Lord gives us today to heal this age.
